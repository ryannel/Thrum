# WATERS log

- 2026-11-14 Owner, through the lead, about `SEA`: "Please make sure the sea work is actually thinking about water
  as a whole. So puddles, rivers, water falls, streams, lakes, and more. We want something that's built
  cohesively." Earlier the same day, of clouds: "The agent should look at that work from first principles and
  figure out how to design the best possible atmospheric system for the thrum game engine."
- 2026-11-14 Planned from the lead's task on those words: one design for all water, a plan and a done-when file
  with eleven milestones. The module is named `WATERS` because `docs/evidence/water` already holds the 1 November
  water evidence and this Mac's file system does not tell `WATER` from `water`.
- 2026-11-14 Planner's decisions. Water is a map (where it lies and how it moves in bulk), waves on it, material
  it carries and one optics, and each kind of water is data for those. Bodies are a sea, a basin or a chart.
  Every body reads `SEA`'s one wave field through four gains, from its fetch and its depth. Flow is prepared
  once, not simulated live. The surface is drawn body by body and shaded by the body the map names at each pixel.
- 2026-11-14 Changed from the sea design: the scene is copied wherever water is thin enough to see through or
  still enough to mirror (nothing on an open sea), water reflects what is on screen, interaction waves take the
  depth from a few computed depths blended per cell, die on dry ground and are carried by the current, and foam
  is born where the depth takes power from the waves. Kept: the query, eWave on two banded levels, the
  reaction-force source, four foam stocks, the frame contract, the two endpoints, capabilities, cost records.
- 2026-11-14 Milestones. M1 is the CPU map and needs `SEA:M1`. M2 to M11 carry `SEA`'s old M3 to M10: each item
  those claims reach was written again, and items were added for the map, a lake and a beach (M4), floating
  inland, rings at depth, shore foam, the bed and the shore's reflection, and a hand-made channel (M9) that
  proves the chart `RIVERS` will write. `CLOUDS` M11 now waits on M8 here.
- 2026-11-14 Planner's reproductions, in [the evidence folder](../../evidence/WATERS/design-proof/). Part H:
  depth bins a factor of two apart carry waves within 1.6% of the finite-depth speed and take under 0.3% of
  their height a second; one operator at a pond's mean depth is 23% fast in its shallows. Part I: at 10 m/s a
  lake with 1 km of fetch takes 0, 0.25, 1 and 1 of the four wave layers, and 1 m of depth holds a 2.1 m sea to
  0.28 of its height.
- 2026-11-14 Asks of other modules: the three seam rulings `SEA` had, now
  [rulings for `WATERS`](../ARCHITECTURE.md#seam-rulings-for-waters), and nothing new. The bed is the game's to
  give. `RIVERS` and `PUDDLES` have briefs in the module list; the wetness of ground will need a ruling with the
  forward pass's owner when `PUDDLES` is planned.
- 2026-11-14 Not read for the design: the Far Cry 5 water talk, Uncharted 4's rapids talk, Fluid Flux's
  documentation and Barnes 2014. Unreal's, HDRP's and Crest's pages were read as fetched summaries. Thornton and
  Guza's ratio and the JONSWAP growth relations are from memory; part I reproduces the second.
